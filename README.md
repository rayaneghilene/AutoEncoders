Generating Images
In recent studies, Groundbreaking research has been done using diffusion models to generate images. However, previously other models were used to perform that task. Image Generation has multiple application in Industries (NFT Creation, Virtual Tryouts, Deep Fake Generation..)

## Introduction

AutoEncoders is a project created to explore the power of autoencoders in various machine learning and deep learning applications. Autoencoders are neural networks used for tasks such as data compression, denoising, and feature extraction. This project provides a collection of practical examples and use cases that demonstrate how autoencoders can be utilized in real-world scenarios.
